      "1. **Venue Selection**: Choose a rooftop restaurant to enjoy the cool evening air and the view of the city. Some popular options include:\n",
      "   - **The Fisherman's Wharf** (for seafood lovers)\n",
      "   - **Oliva** (for a mix of Mediterranean and Indian cuisine)\n",
      "   - **Sky Lounge at the Hitech City** (offers a vibrant atmosphere with a great skyline view)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cuisine Suggestion**: Since the weather is pleasant, you might want to enjoy some outdoor seating. Consider trying:\n",
      "   - **Appetizers**: Start with some spicy Continental finger foods or Indian chaats.\n",
      "   - **Main Course**: Opt for a Hyderabadi biryani or a hearty Italian pasta.\n",
      "   - **Dessert**: Don’t miss out on a local sweet like double ka meetha or a rich chocolate lava cake.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Beverages**: Pair your meal with some chilled drinks. Consider:\n",
      "   - A refreshing mocktail or a classic lemonade.\n",
      "   - If you enjoy alcoholic beverages, explore some local wines or craft beers.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Post-Dinner Activity**: After your meal, take a stroll at a nearby park or visit a local night market if you’re in the mood for some light shopping or street food exploration.\n",

      "### Reservations:\n",
      "Make sure to book a table in advance, especially if the restaurant has a view, to secure the best spot.\n",
